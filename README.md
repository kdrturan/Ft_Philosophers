# 🧠 Philosophers

An implementation of Edsger Dijkstra’s classic **Dining Philosophers** concurrency problem, developed in C for the **42 Cursus**.

The goal is to simulate philosophers who share forks, eat, think, and sleep — all while avoiding deadlocks and starvation using multithreading and proper synchronization primitives.

## 🛠️ Compilation

```bash
cd philo
make         # Builds ./philo
make clean   # Deletes object files
make fclean  # Deletes object files + binary
make re      # Full rebuild

✅ No external libraries are required except for pthread, which is linked automatically via the Makefile. The code is written in pure ANSI C, and any modern GCC or Clang compiler will work.

🚀 Usage

./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep \
        [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
Argument	Description
number_of_philosophers	Number of philosophers and forks (1–200).
time_to_die	Time in ms a philosopher can go without eating before dying.
time_to_eat	Time in ms a philosopher spends eating (forks held).
time_to_sleep	Time in ms a philosopher spends sleeping.
number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional)	If provided, simulation ends when all philosophers eat this many times.

📌 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
$ ./philo 5 310 200 100
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 is eating

🧩 Algorithm Overview
🔹 Initialization
Parse and validate CLI arguments.

Allocate a t_program instance.

Create n mutexes (forks) and spawn one thread per philosopher.

🔹 Philosopher Routine (philo_routine)
Loop: think → take forks → eat → sleep.

Odd and even philosopher IDs pick up forks in opposite order to avoid circular wait (deadlock).

🔹 Monitor Thread (routine_check)
Continuously checks if any philosopher has exceeded time_to_die.

Ends simulation if:

A philosopher dies.

OR all philosophers have eaten meals_to_finish times.

🔹 Shutdown
Join/detach all threads.

Destroy all mutexes and free allocated memory.

🧠 Deadlock Avoidance
This implementation prevents deadlocks by varying fork acquisition order between even and odd philosophers. The simulation respects the four necessary conditions for deadlock and intentionally breaks the circular wait condition.

🧪 Testing & Debugging
Tool	Command	Purpose
Valgrind	valgrind --leak-check=full ./philo …	Detects memory leaks and invalid accesses.
AddressSanitizer	CFLAGS='-g -fsanitize=address' make re	Runtime checks for memory issues (fast, useful).
strace/ltrace	strace -c ./philo …	Trace system calls and mutex/futex behavior.
